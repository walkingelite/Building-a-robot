Perfect — you’re now building a legged general-purpose humanoid robot, starting in simulation. This is a smart move since it saves cost, lets you test architecture and motion safely, and prepares your code for real hardware.

🧩 Overall Goal

Simulate a full humanoid robot with:

Legs (bipedal walking)

Arms and hands (basic manipulation)

Head with camera (vision)

Voice interaction

General-purpose behavior



---

🎯 Step 1: Choose Your Simulation Environment

For humanoid robots, the best options are:

Simulator	Notes

Gazebo (ROS 2 Native)	Most common for ROS-based robots; physics + sensors
Isaac Sim (NVIDIA)	GPU-accelerated, realistic physics; supports ROS 2
Webots	Easier setup, visual UI, good for quick iteration
PyBullet	Lightweight, programmable via Python
MuJoCo	High-quality leg simulation (used in Google DeepMind)


✅ RECOMMENDATION: Start with Gazebo + ROS 2 if you're serious about moving to real hardware later.


---

🦿 Step 2: Get a Humanoid URDF Model

You’ll need a robot description file (URDF) that defines your robot’s body, joints, links, sensors.

Good starting options:

Robot	Source

Talos	PAL Robotics, full humanoid
Valkyrie	NASA
HRP-4	AIST Japan
OpenHumanoids	GitHub community models
Custom	Build your own URDF in stages (head → arms → torso → legs)


✅ We can start with Open Source Talos or a simplified bipedal model, then expand.


---

🧠 Step 3: Set Up Software Stack

Install the following:

1. Ubuntu 22.04


2. ROS 2 Humble or Iron


3. Gazebo Fortress or Garden


4. ros2_control (for motor interfaces)


5. rviz2 (for visualization)



Optional: Blender (if you want to design your own 3D robot body).


---

🦾 Step 4: Simulate One Subsystem at a Time

We’ll build one layer at a time:

1. ✅ Standing Legged Robot

URDF of humanoid with legs

Use ros2_control and joint_state_publisher_gui to manually move joints

Balance is fake for now (fixed base or no physics)



2. ✅ Bipedal Leg Movement

Add simple walking gait with inverse kinematics

Can use moveit2 or ikfast, or program manually in Python



3. ✅ Arm & Grasp Simulation

Add joint controllers to arms

Use RViz to simulate reaching



4. ✅ Camera Input + Vision AI

Simulated camera from Gazebo

Use YOLO or Mediapipe to detect objects

Send target joint positions to arm



5. ✅ Voice AI Integration

Use speech_recognition Python package

Add simple rule-based task planner:
“Pick up bottle” → arm trajectory → joint angle command



6. ✅ High-Level Behavior Node

This acts as brain

Coordinates inputs: camera + voice + state

Decides what to do using rules or an LLM (offline GPT model)

🛠️ Tools We Will Use

Tool	Purpose

ROS 2	Middleware and robot control
Gazebo	Simulation (physics + 3D world)
RViz2	Visualize robot state
MoveIt 2	Motion planning for arms and legs
Python	High-level control, AI integration
ONNX / TensorRT	Run AI models like YOLO, CLIP, Whisper
URDF / Xacro	Robot model definition

✅ What You Can Do Right Now

1. ✅ Install ROS 2 Humble + Gazebo on Ubuntu


2. ✅ Pick a robot URDF to start from (I can help generate or download it)


3. ✅ Launch the robot in simulation


4. ✅ Add basic controllers for arm/leg movement


5. ✅ Start writing Python scripts to simulate behavior
