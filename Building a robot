Great — you're now entering real robotic system engineering. Let’s begin with the step-by-step roadmap for building a general-purpose AI robot, like a prototype of Tesla Optimus or Figure 01, but simplified and doable.

We’ll structure this in phases so it’s actionable.


---

🛠️ PHASE 1: DEFINE THE PURPOSE

> Before you build, define what your robot should do.



Questions to answer:

Will it walk? Or just move arms/head?

Will it interact with objects? (e.g., grab, hand over, point?)

Will it speak and understand you?

Will it see with a camera and react?


💡 Let’s say:
"Build a general-purpose robot with a head (camera), arms, hands, voice interaction, and wheels (instead of legs for now)."

⚙️ PHASE 2: CHOOSE THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS

1. 🧠 Main Computer

Handles AI, vision, planning.

Option 1: Jetson Orin Nano / Xavier (AI onboard)

Option 2: Intel NUC or Raspberry Pi + cloud-based AI


2. 🧾 Microcontrollers (MCUs)

Low-level control of motors and sensors.

Popular Choices: Teensy 4.1, STM32, ESP32 (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)


3. 📸 Sensors

Camera: Intel RealSense, OAK-D, or webcam (for vision and depth)

IMU: Gyroscope + accelerometer (balance/motion)

Microphone Array: Voice commands (ReSpeaker, USB mics)


4. 🤖 Actuators

Arms/Hands: Servo motors (Dynamixel, smart servos)

Wheels: DC motors with encoders

Optional: Gripper with force sensors


5. 🔌 Motor Drivers

For DC motors: L298N, ODrive, Roboclaw

For smart servos: Built-in driver (e.g., Dynamixel)


6. 🔋 Power System

Li-ion or Li-Po battery packs (12V or 24V)

Battery Management System (BMS)

🧠 PHASE 3: PLAN THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

You’ll stack software like this:

Main Computer
├── Linux + ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
├── AI Models (Vision, NLP, Planning)
├── Motion Planner
└── Middleware (ROS nodes for each module)
     ├── Vision Node (gets camera frames)
     ├── Voice Node (speech recognition)
     ├── Task Planner (decides what to do)
     ├── Trajectory Generator (joint angles)
     └── Communication Node (sends to MCU)

Microcontroller (C/C++)
└── Motor Driver Code
     └── Accept joint angle commands (serial/CAN/Wi-Fi)
     └── PID loop → motor driver → actuator


---

🧪 PHASE 4: BUILD AND INTEGRATE (Order of Action)

🔹 A. Start Small – Arm with 2–3 Servos

Connect servos to MCU (Teensy or ESP32)

Write firmware to move servos to angles via serial input

Control it from a Python script over USB or Wi-Fi


🔹 B. Add Vision Input

Connect a camera

Run object detection (YOLOv8 or Mediapipe for pose)

Send joint angles based on vision to the MCU


🔹 C. Add Voice Commands

Use Whisper + SpeechRecognition in Python

Convert speech → intent → command


🔹 D. Combine with ROS

Install ROS 2 on your Jetson/RPi/NUC

Create ROS nodes:

/vision

/voice

/planner

/motor_comm



🔹 E. Add Base (Wheels)

DC motors + encoders + ODrive or Roboclaw

Add motion planning for driving (Nav2 stack in ROS)



---

🌐 PHASE 5: NETWORKING & EXPANSION

Mesh/Remote Communication

Use ESP-NOW or NRF24L01+ for MCU-to-MCU mesh

ROS 2 over DDS can connect multiple robots via Wi-Fi

Bluetooth for nearby pairing

✅ What You Should Do Next

1. ✅ Choose a main board: Jetson Nano or RPi + microcontroller


2. ✅ Buy a smart servo (like LewanSoul LX-16A or Dynamixel)


3. ✅ Make the servo move by sending a command from your PC


4. ✅ Add a camera and detect your hand using AI


5. ✅ Use that detection to move the servo → first end-to-end pipeline
